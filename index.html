        <p>In the wake of the sad passing of the supremely gorgeous late Diana Rigg it brings to mind the Bond film she featured in On Her Majesty’s Service. The legendary actress played the exquisitely seductive Countess Tracy di Vicenzo.<br><br>

            Like every other Bond story, this one features a masterly villain with ambitions of world domination, but few are so iconic as Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Most recently portrayed by Christoph Waltz in Spectre, Blofeld has appeared in seven other Bond films and is often seen stroking his white Persian cat in evil contemplation.
            One such appearance is in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service”, one of the more divisive Bond films thanks to its leading man, George Lazenby, who played the role of 007 just the once. Although the 1969 film received a lukewarm reception from critics, many consider it to be one of the best in the series, in part because of its spectacular scenery.
            <br><br>
            The site of Blofeld’s secret lair, Piz Gloria, is atop the 2,970m summit of the Schilthorn in Switzerland’s Bernese Alps. This is one of the only places in the world where the public can experience a Bond film set up close and personal.
