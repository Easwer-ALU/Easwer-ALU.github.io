       <p>While searching for the ideal film location for Blofeld’s lair, the production team came across a partly constructed sports bar with a revolving floor on the Schilthorn summit. Set against a backdrop of dramatic, snow-topped mountains, which includes the indomitable Eiger, it seemed the perfect setting for a villainous plot. <br><br>The film’s producer agreed to finance its completion in exchange for exclusive filming rights.
        Since filming ended, the building has retained its Piz Gloria moniker, taking full advantage of the Bond connection. The restaurant has floor-to-ceiling windows and revolves a full 360 degrees in 55 minutes. The family-friendly menu includes the fan favourite “007 burger” complete with a 007 stamped logo on the bun.

        As well as a restaurant, there is also a permanent exhibition containing Bond memorabilia and film clips on the lower floor. While this could seem a little corny, the “Bond World” exhibition is actually very well presented, with a great selection of iconic Bond posters, part of the helicopter used in the film and various interactive games and entertainment.
