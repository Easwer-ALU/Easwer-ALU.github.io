       <p>As you exit the cable car at the top of the Schilthorn, you are immediately presented with some rather spectacular views of the mountains surrounding the region. This includes the Jungfrau, Eiger and Jura Mountains.<br><br> On a clear day, you can also see Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps. There is a large, open area covered with tables and chairs, where you can relax with a cocktail and enjoy the views.<br>If you’re feeling more adventurous, you can take part in the “thrill walk”, a 200m long steel and glass walkway that hugs the rock and leads to the cable car station. Not one for vertigo sufferers, the walkway is both narrow and high, but you are rewarded with uninterrupted views of the valley of Lauterbrunnen.<br><br> You can also channel your inner Bond and attempt to crawl though an (optional) eight-metre tunnel with clear views of the 250m drop below.If you haven’t had enough of 007 by now, there is a new exhibition outside called the “007 Walk of Fame”: a series of statues featuring handprints of the film’s cast and crew and information about their time on set. The opening event in 2015 was attended by George Lazenby himself.</p>
